## `.cursor/skills/`

Place repo-specific Cursor skills here (or documentation for them).

If you later add installable skills, keep each skill in its own folder with clear
instructions and examples.

### Included skills

- **`github-for-business`**: After Git/GitHub actions, explains what happened using plain-English + Google Docs analogies (push/PR/review/merge/conflicts).
- **`terminal-training-wheels`**: After terminal-heavy answers, appends a short beginner guide (where to run commands, what success looks like, common fixes).
