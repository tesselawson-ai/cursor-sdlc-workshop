# Base MVP -- Hudson River Runner

This folder is where the game code lives.

## Phase 2: Build the MVP (One Person)

**One team member** scaffolds the base game here. This is the foundation everyone else builds on.

### What to Build

A minimal, playable boat game:
- Vite + React project with HTML5 Canvas
- Scrolling river with shoreline banks
- A boat the player steers left/right
- Icebergs that spawn and scroll toward the player
- Collision detection (hit = game over)
- Distance meter (reach 12 miles = win)
- Start screen, playing state, and game over screen

### Instructions

1. Tell Cursor to read the `prd.md` in the Team_Hudson folder
2. Tell Cursor to generate the base MVP here
3. Tell Cursor to run it locally and verify it works

### After You're Done

> **Ask Cursor:** "Commit all my changes with the message 'Team_Hudson - Base MVP scaffold', push to my fork, and open a PR to the original repo"

Once the PR is merged, your teammates can build their features on top of it!
