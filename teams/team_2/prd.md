# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Instructions:** This is your team's project specification. Fill in the sections below to define what you're building.

---

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** _[Give your project a name]_

**One-line Description:** _[What does it do in one sentence?]_

**Type:** _[e.g., Chrome Extension, Web App, CLI Tool, etc.]_

---

## Guidelines

### Keep It Small!
- Your MVP should be buildable in **10 minutes** by one person
- Think "proof of concept" not "production ready"
- If it sounds ambitious, make it simpler

### Good Project Ideas
- A simple Chrome extension (e.g., changes page colors, adds a button)
- A single-page web app (e.g., a counter, a todo list, a timer)
- A typing-speed game that measures your words per minute

### Bad Project Ideas (Too Big!)
- Anything with a database
- Anything requiring authentication
- Anything with multiple pages/screens
- Anything that "needs" an API

## Team Members & Tasks

> **Important:** Each team member MUST have their own task. Tasks should be independent features that can be built in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.

| Name | Task | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| _[Name 1]_ | _[Feature 1]_ | _[Brief description]_ |
| _[Name 2]_ | _[Feature 2]_ | _[Brief description]_ |
| _[Name 3]_ | _[Feature 3]_ | _[Brief description]_ |
| _[Name 4]_ | _[Feature 4]_ | _[Brief description]_ |
| _[Name 5]_ | _[Feature 5]_ | _[Brief description]_ |

### Task Guidelines
- Each task should add something **visible** to the project
- Tasks should be **independent** — no dependencies on other tasks
- Think: new button, new section, new color scheme, new text, etc.
- Everyone should be able to work at the same time without conflicts

---

## Base MVP (Phase 2)

> **One person** creates the foundation that everyone else builds on.

**What the MVP includes:**
- _[Describe the minimal working version]_

**What it does NOT include:**
- _[List features deliberately left out for team members to add]_

---

## Feature Slots (Phase 3)

> These are the features team members will add. Design them to be **independent** so people can work in parallel.

### Feature 1: _[Name]_
- **Assigned to:** _[Team member]_
- **Description:** _[What it does]_
- **Files to modify/create:** _[Be specific]_

### Feature 2: _[Name]_
- **Assigned to:** _[Team member]_
- **Description:** _[What it does]_
- **Files to modify/create:** _[Be specific]_

### Feature 3: _[Name]_

### Feature 4: _[Name]_
