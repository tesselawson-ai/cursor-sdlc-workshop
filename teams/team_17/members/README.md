# Team Members

Each team member creates their own file in this folder.

## What to Do

1. Create a new file named `[your-name].md` (e.g., `alice.md`)
2. Add your info using the template below
3. Commit and push with your team's setup branch

## Template

```markdown
# [Your Name]

**Role:** [AE/FE/ADM]
**Fun fact:** [Something about you]
```

## Example

```markdown
# Alice Smith

**Role:** AE
**Fun fact:** I once debugged a production issue while skydiving (not recommended)
```

## Example File Structure

When your team is done, this folder should look like:

```
members/
├── README.md
├── alice.md
├── bob.md
├── carlos.md
├── diana.md
└── eve.md
```

Each `.md` file contains that person's info using the template above.

## Why This Matters

This is your first git exercise! Everyone on the team will:
1. Create their own file
2. Stage it (`git add .`)
3. Commit together
4. Push and open a PR

If multiple people try to push at the same time... you'll get to experience your first merge conflict. Welcome to collaborative development!
